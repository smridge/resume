### Staff Software Engineer at Ellevest
![Miami, FL | Remote](https://img.shields.io/badge/Miami%2C_FL-Remote-gray?color=green) ![FinTech](https://img.shields.io/badge/FinTech-gray)

**October 2022 - July 2023**

- Founded a Backend Stability and Security team which supported several cross team initiatives (3 direct reports)

**Highlights**
- Led initiatives to reduce our errors, warnings, and deprecations for multiple applications. For all areas, our issues were reduced by 98% month over month which significantly improved our signal to noise ratio. Additionally, these efforts reduced our observability software costs by $26K annually.

- Led initiatives for improving our test coverage and reducing technical debt across multiple applications. By removing technical debt, our lead time started to improve. By forcing test coverage minimums, developers improved their automated testing skills and have consistently introduced fewer bugs. For core areas, we backfilled test coverage. Overall, our test coverage was increased by over 50% with an aggregate test coverage above 80%.

- Contributed to reducing our monthly database storage costs by 15% by ensuring database optimization and cleanup tasks consistently run as expected.

- Led multiple initiatives for resolving our known security vulnerabilities related to our packages and pentest results. Much of the work described above aided the efforts in updating our applications to ensure we are able to patch our software without any production issues.

- Established organization and team level goals that were consistently achieved

- Backend Engineer for the Customer Experience (CX) Team
- Developed and maintained APIs for multiple services

**Highlights**:
- Technical Lead for an Engineering Initiative for all backend repositories to utilize the `OpenAPI` documentation specification. [Developed and published an open source tool](https://github.com/smridge/swagcov) to automatically check (pass/fail) build pipelines for documentation coverage. Diligently documented simple and complex examples for other engineers to adopt new approach of testing mixed with documentation. Brought our `OpenAPI` endpoint documentation coverage from less than 20% to over 90% with higher accuracy.

- Technical Lead for upgrading to major versions for `Ruby` and `Rails`. Both upgrades had zero production issues due to the technical approaches implemented.

- Technical Lead for implementing a Tiered Pricing Model. This included working with multiple stakeholders across various teams and departments. With the technical approaches outlined, scoped, developed and tested, the final product/feature was delivered well before the release date. The bonus being that because this was developed in a fully backwards compatible fashion, our sales teams were able to close deals with the new tiered pricing model pre-release.

- Technical Lead for implementing a conversion to a new Credit Model. These changes impacted nearly every area of our business. This was another project that required a deep level of understanding multiple teams and departments. Not only were the technical processes outlined, scoped, developed and tested thoroughly, it was another area where communication really mattered and was effective. The success of this project was highlighted by the fact that the transition was seamless with nearly zero downtime and exactly zero post-release malfunctions.
